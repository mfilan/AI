    "# Local search and constraint satisfaction problems\n",
    "\n",
    "During the previous classes we were concerned with finding a sequence of actions (a plan) to reach one of the goal states from a predefined initial state. In a sense, we were more interested in the *journey* rather than in the *destination* itself: our goal was to transform the initial state to the goal state, not to construct the goal state from scratch. Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) are different from them: we are not interested in the journey, only in the destination. We are again in a situation where we can recognize a goal state, but we don't care how we get there, the only interesting aspect is finding a state that satisfies all specified constraints. Local search is also different from tree/graph search algorithms like A*: it assumes that all intermediate states are acceptable, but they differ in their quality and the goal is to find the best solution."

    "## Constraint satisfaction problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tasks the state was opaque: an algorithm could execute an action and transform a state to another state, but that was it. It could not depend in its search on the details of a state, because the state representation was different from problem to problem. In CSP this is no longer true: the state always consists of an assignment of values over some domains to variables. This enables an algorithm to interact with the state directly, not only through opaque actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Allowed assignments are limited by constraints in the problem and broadly speaking they can be divided into three groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Unary constraints* each concerning only a single variable (e.g., $x>0$)\n",
    "* *Binary constraints* relating two variables to each other (e.g., $x>y$)\n",
    "* *General constraints* concerning more than two variables at once\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the shape of constraints is unrestricted and we are not limited to numeric domains and constraints in the form of inequalities. In principle, one could employ arbitrary boolean functions as constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following class `CSP` is a very limited representation of such a problem capable only of handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* unary constraints defined in terms of Python's operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` and `in` such that the left-hand side of the operator is a variable and the right-hand side is a constant\n",
    "* binary constraints defined in terms of Python's operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` such that both sides are variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "About its methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The constructor (`__init__`) requires a single argument: a domain shared by all the variables. This is not used by the class itself, but it is exposed as a field `domain` to be used by algorithms solving a CSP modelled this way.\n",
    "* `addUnaryConstraint` requires three arguments: \n",
    "    * `var` - a variable (a string representing ins name, but really, it could be any object);\n",
    "    * `op` - an operator (one of the following strings: `'=='`, `'!='`, `'<'`, `'<='`, `'>'`, `'>='` and `'in'`)\n",
    "    * `value` - an element of the domain for all the operators except `in` and a subset of the domain for the `in` operator\n",
    "* `addBinaryConstraint` also requires three arguments:\n",
    "    * `var1` - a variable, the left-hand side of the constraint\n",
    "    * `op` - an operator (one of the following strings: `'=='`, `'!='`, `'<'`, `'<='`, `'>'`, `'>='`)\n",
    "    * `var2` - a variable, the right-hand side of the constraint\n",
    "* `verify` gets a single argument: a (partial) solution in the form of a Python's dictionary mapping variables to values and returns a pair of numbers. The first it the number constraints satisfied by the provided solution, the second is the number of unsatisfied constraints."

    "Continuing with the biological analogies, the encoding represents a genotype, whereas the encoded solution represents a phenotype.\n",
